Things Todo:

- Make the library choose the best optimal mask pattern.
    As for now, it allways chooses mask 3 when set to autochoose.

- Better Makefiles
	- Use Autotools or CMake
	- Make them work on windows, linux and os x
	- Discover if there is no gtk+-2.0 and then don't build -w support in sample program.

- With some sizes, there are white lines between the data modules

- make Python bindings more object oriented

- Create man pages for programs and headers

- Create doxygen or other documentation

- Support other graphic libraries than cairo.

- Option to read data from file

- Option to list statistics
	which version, ecLevel and encodeMode can have how many characters?
	(possibility to print only for specified version, ecLevel and/or encode mode)
