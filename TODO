Things Todo:

- Make the library choose the best optimal mask pattern.
As for now, it allways chooses mask 3.

- Get rid of the 3 .rc files.
Now, there are 3 .rc files in the rc folder. We need to make the program find the rc files (for example at /usr/local/share/qrgen or ~/.qrgen),
or hardcode the data into the sourcecode.

- Better Makefiles
	- Use Autotools
	- Discover if there is no gtk+-2.0 and then don't build -w support in sample program.

- Make the library more resistant to invalid input and other errors.

- Create an gui example program

- Create man pages for programs and headers

- Improve api for the library
	- Make it possible to write directly to a file, without supplying a cairo surface.
	- Make it possible to choose, where on the surface the qrcode is drawn.
	- Support other graphic libraries than cairo.
