Things Todo:

- Make the library choose the best optimal mask pattern.
As for now, it allways chooses mask 3.

- Get rid of the 3 .rc files.
Now, there are 3 .rc files in the rc folder. We need to make the program find the rc files (for example at /usr/local/share/qrgen or ~/.qrgen),
or hardcode the data into the sourcecode.

- Better Makefiles
	- Use Autotools or CMake
	- Make them work on windows, linux and os x
	- Discover if there is no gtk+-2.0 and then don't build -w support in sample program.

- Make the library more resistant to invalid input and other errors.

- Create an gui example program

- Python bindings

- Create man pages for programs and headers

- Improve api for the library
	- Make it possible to write directly to a file, without supplying a cairo surface.
	- Make it possible to choose, where on the surface the qrcode is drawn.
	- Support other graphic libraries than cairo.

- Option to add quiet zone

- Option to read data from file
	
- Option to choose optimal size
	For example, version 3 has 29x29 bits, maybe we want each bit to be an absolute number of pixels wide
	so for every bit to be 3x3 Pixels, size needs to be 29*3 = 87. Let the program calculate that by itself.
	If we have version 5 (37x37) and say size = 340, the nearest optimal size is 333 (9*37).

	--optimal-size [min|max|nearest]
		min   take the next larger optimal size
		max   take the next smaller optimal size
		nearest (default)   take the nearest optimal size

	--optimal-version
		choose the version that fits most the optimal size:
		example: minimum version is 9, size is 340, so version 9 goes to 371, version 10 goes to 342 and version 11 goes to 366
		the optimal version is 10, because its optimal size is the nearest to the desired size
		(but it needs a way to say a maximal version, so its not version 38 when only version 3 is needed, just because of a few pixels)

	--bitSize
		set the size of one bit of the qr code,
		example: version 13, bitSize 12, v13 has 69x69 bits, so 69*12=828
		this option overrides --optimal-size

- Option to list statistics
	which version, ecLevel and encodeMode can have how many characters?
	(possibility to print only for specified version, ecLevel and/or encode mode)
