    As for now, it allways chooses mask 3 when set to autochoose.

- Better Makefiles
	- Use Autotools or CMake
	- Make them work on windows, linux and os x
	- Discover if there is no gtk+-2.0 and then don't build -w support in sample program.

- Create an gui example program

- Python bindings

- Create man pages for programs and headers

- Support other graphic libraries than cairo.

- Option to read data from file

- Option to list statistics
